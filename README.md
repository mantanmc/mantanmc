## Hi there 👋
- Developers and Anime Lovers 👌
- I watch anime at night 👀
- I dual boot Ubuntu LTS and Windows 11 ✌️

~ Unfortunately, I don't use Arch :) Arch is unstable and most of its packages are unofficial and come from third parties. Even though it's open source, do you trust them? It's like them saying, “Dude, trust me this package is safe.” but it would be worse if you didn't know what they were doing. ~

Do what you know.
